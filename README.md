According to Indonesian criminal statistics of 2021 generated by the BPS, gambling cases in Indonesia are increasing every year. Not only off the line, the same can be said for the online gambling cases. This is validated by the hundreds of public complaints addressed to Kominfo every month regarding websites with negative content including gambling. As an anticipatory measure, the government has created a system for detecting negative content websites called TrustPositif, but it is still considered ineffective in the detection process. 

In this study, the author proposed a method to build a gambling website detection system using feature extraction methods in the form of unigram, bigram, and trigram as a reference for classifying the target website. This gambling site detection system will use the URL of the target website as an input, crawl its content and then proceed to predict whether itâ€™s classified as a gambling site or not using two algorithms: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. 

The conclusion obtained after training and testing the dataset, it can be proven that the implementation of feature extraction methods of bigram and trigram combined with the Naive Bayes algorithm are quite effective for classifying websites, with the precision and recall values of 99% and the results of system testing was also getting a score of 90%.
